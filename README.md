# Simple Spring Boot REST API for Stock Prices

## Overview

This project is a really simple Spring Boot-based REST API developed as part of an interview task. Its primary function is to fetch and provide time series data, specifically stock prices, upon request.
To enhance performance and reduce latency, this API leverages Redis for caching.

Front-end application that utilizes this API: [Stock Chart App](https://github.com/Millenium47/stock-chart-app).
